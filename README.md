# Accent Applicator
Windows 10 introduced a system-wide accent color system that automatically applies
a custom color to many parts of the UI including third-party apps. Unfortunately, only
apps made for the Universal Windows Platform benefit from this feature while desktop apps
are limited to the same color scheme since Vista.

Accent Applicator is a light program for Windows 10 that applies your accent color to 
some UI elements in desktop apps by updating *System Colors* (i.e. the theme colors used by desktop
apps) based on your accent color. These changes are usually subtle, but they contribute in 
reducing the disparities between the classic desktop environment and Universal apps.

## Development Status
I am no longer actively developing this app. It is still available in the Windows Store for now,
and I am still occasionally testing it on the latest release of Windows 10, but I do not expect to
invest any more resources on it.

If you encounter a bug or would like to request a feature, you may still open an issue, but I make
no promise of responding to it.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this project!
