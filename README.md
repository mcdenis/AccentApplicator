# Accent Applicator
Windows 10 introduced a system-wide accent color system that automatically applies
a custom color to many parts of the UI including third-party apps. Unfortunately, only
apps made for the Universal Windows Platform benefit from this feature while desktop apps
are limited to the same color scheme since Vista.

Accent CS is a light program for Windows 10 that applies your accent color to 
some UI elements in desktop apps by updating *System Colors* (i.e. the theme colors used by desktop apps) 
based on your accent color. These changes are usually subtle, but they contribute in 
reducing the disparities between the classic desktop environment and Universal apps.
